This package works for computing distributions of the following types:
Normal, Binomial and General.
They are defined as classes to be instantiated with its respective distributional parameters.
For example: To instantiate an object of a standard normal distribution you should write "Gaussian(0,1)"
Or to instantiate an object of a binomial distribution with a probability of success of .4 and 20 trials: "Binomial(.4,20)".
